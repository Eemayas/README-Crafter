# Project Overview

This project involves developing a custom module called \`scrapper\` for scraping product data from an e-commerce platform, with specific focus on extracting detailed information about products listed on Daraz.com. The module is designed to automatically generate email notifications to users based on certain criteria related to product updates, such as changes in stock availability or price drops. 

The project utilizes Node.js and various libraries like Nodemailer for sending emails and Cheerio for HTML parsing, along with Mongoose for MongoDB interactions. Key features of the project include its ability to track product prices and stock levels, send alerts when products become available again after being out of stock, notify users about price drops exceeding a certain threshold (40% in this case), and welcome new users who start tracking a product. The project's setup involves configuring Nodemailer with authentication details for sending emails from a specific account.`;
